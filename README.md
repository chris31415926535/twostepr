Spatial accessibility analysis made easy! The goal of **twostepr** is to
make it easy to run two-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) analyses in
R using a modern and tidy interface.

*Please note* this is an extremely early experimental in-development
package that *probably does not work yet*.

<!-- You can install the released version of twostepr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->
